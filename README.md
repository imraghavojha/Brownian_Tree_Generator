# 🎨 Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) Simulation

## 🤔 What is this project?
Make beautiful snowflake-like patterns using Python! Particles move randomly and stick together to create amazing fractal shapes. ❄️

## 📁 Project Files
- 📝 `Python_Cheatsheet.py`: Your Python syntax guide
- ⚡ `pseudocode.py`: Working example to learn from
- 🚀 `main.py`: Where you'll write your code!

## 🎮 How it works
1. 🎯 Start with one particle in center
2. ✨ New particles appear randomly
3. 🎲 Particles move around randomly
4. 🤝 When they touch, they stick together
5. 🌟 Keep going until you have a cool pattern!

## 🛠️ What you'll need
- Python
- Two packages: `numpy` and `matplotlib`
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## 💡 Tips for Success
1. Start small! Begin with:
   - 🏗️ Create grid
   - ⭐ Add center particle
   - 🎯 Make one particle move
2. 🐞 Test often with `print()`!
3. 🎨 Add features one by one
4. 📝 Comment your code

## 🚨 Common Problems
- Particles disappearing? Check your boundaries! 🔍
- Nothing sticking? Check collision code! 🤝
- Too slow? Use fewer particles! ⚡
- Pattern too small? Adjust starting positions! 🔄

Have fun creating your own unique patterns! 🌈✨
